Chess Programming Wiki 
https://www.chessprogramming.org/Main_Page

The Chess Programming Wiki is a repository of information about programming computers to play chess. 
Our goal is to provide a reference for every aspect of chess-programming, information about programmers, 
researcher and engines. You'll find different ways to implement LMR and bitboard stuff like best magics 
for most dense magic bitboard tables. For didactic purposes, the CPW-Engine has been developed by some wiki members. 
You can start browsing using the left-hand navigation bar. All of our content is arranged hierarchically,
so you can see every page by following just those links.
